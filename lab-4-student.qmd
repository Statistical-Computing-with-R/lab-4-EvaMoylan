## The Data

In this lab we're going look at the median weekly cost of childcare in
California. A detailed description of the data can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/readme.md).

The data come to us from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

**1. Load the appropriate libraries and the data.**

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)

```

```{r}
#| label: load-data
#| message: false

childcare_costs <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/childcare_costs.csv')

counties <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/counties.csv')

glimpse(childcare_costs)
glimpse(counties)
```

**1. Briefly describe the dataset (~ 4 sentences). What information does it contain?**

*The childcare_costs data set includes childcare price data along with attributes of that child like information about their care provider(s), characteristics of the county they live in and their age. These data were collected during 2008-2018 in the United States. The counties data set includes counties within the USA with their corresponding code, and the state they are in.*


## California Childcare Costs

Let's start by focusing only on California. 

**2. Create a `ca_childcare` dataset of childcare costs in California, containing (1) county information and (2) all information from the `childcare_costs` dataset.** 
*Hint: There are 58 counties in CA and 11 years in the dataset. Therefore, your new dataset should have 53 x 11 = 638 observations.*

```{r}
#| label: ca-childcare-costs

ca_childcare <- childcare_costs |>
  inner_join(counties,
             by = "county_fips_code" #just joining with one key so don't need to use 'join_by'
            ) |>
  filter(state_abbreviation == "CA")

ca_childcare |>
  distinct(county_name)

```

**3. Using a function from the `forcats` package, complete the code below to create a new variable where each county is categorized into one of the [10 Census regions](https://census.ca.gov/regions/) in California. Use the Region description (from the plot), not the Region number.**  
*Hint: This is probably a good place to use ChatGPT to reduce on tedious work. But you do need to know how to prompt ChatGPT to make it useful!*

                               ))
  
# Check data with the new 'region' column
print(ca_childcare)
```

**4. Let's consider the median household income of each region, and how that income has changed over time. Create a table with ten rows, one for each region, and two columns, one for 2008 and one for 2018. The cells should contain the `median` of the median household income (expressed in 2018 dollars) of the `region` and the `study_year`. Arrange the rows by 2018 values.**

```{r}
#| label: median-income-by-region-over-time

ca_childcare |>
  group_by(region, study_year) |>
  summarize(mhi_2018 = median(mhi_2018),
            .groups = "drop") |> #values now are median for each year at each county 
  filter(study_year %in% c(2008, 
                         2018)) |>
  pivot_wider(id_cols = "region", #region stays from original table orientation 
              names_from = study_year, #I want 2008 and 2018 to become columns
              values_from = mhi_2018) |>  #I want the corresponding values to be this
  select(c(`2008`,`2018`)) |>
  arrange(desc(`2018`))

```

**5. Which California `region` had the lowest `median` full-time median weekly price for center-based childcare for infants in 2018? Does this `region` correspond to the `region` with the lowest `median` income in 2018 that you found in Q4?**  
*Hint: The code should give me the EXACT answer. This means having the code output the exact row(s) and variable(s) necessary for providing the solution.*

```{r}
#| label: lowest-median-weekly-price-2018

ca_childcare |>
  group_by(region, study_year) |>
  summarize(mhi_2018 = median(mhi_2018), #values now are median for each year at each county
            mc_infant = median(mc_infant),
            .groups = 'drop') |>
  filter(study_year == 2018) |>
  pivot_wider(id_cols = "region", #region stays from original table orientation 
              names_from = study_year,
              values_from = c(mhi_2018,
                              mc_infant)) |> 
  slice_min(mc_infant_2018) #Superior CA has the lowest med childcare for infants in 2018

```
*Superior California has the lowest `median` full-time median weekly price of center-based childcare for infants in 2018. This region also has the lowest `median` median household income in 2018.*

**6. The following plot shows, for all ten regions, the change over time of the full-time median price for center-based childcare for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers. Recreate the plot. You do not have to replicate the exact colors or theme, but your plot should have the same content, including the order of the facets and legend, reader-friendly labels, axes breaks, and a loess smoother.**

```


## Median Household Income vs. Childcare Costs for Infants

**7. Create a scatterplot showing the relationship between median household income (expressed in 2018 dollars) and the full-time median weekly price charged for center-based childcare for an infant in California. Overlay a linear regression line (lm) to show the trend.**

```{r}
#| label: scatterplot-median-income-vs-childcare-cost

```

**8. Look up the documentation for `lm()` and fit a linear regression model to the relationship shown in your plot above.**

```{r}
#| label: linear-model

# complete the code provided
#reg_mod1 <- lm()
#summary(reg_mod1)
```

**9. Using the output from `summary()`, write out the estimated regression line (recall: $y = mx + b$).**

**10. Do you have evidence to conclude there is a relationship between the median household income and the median weekly cost of center-based childcare for infants in California? Cite values from your `summary()` output to support your claim!**
